# LargeScaleOptimization

This repository contains all of the files for an independent study course in Spring 2016. The goals of the course were as follows:

1. Learn about sparse matrices and what makes their structure unique for programming.

2. Design and implement an algorithm to store a sparse matrix.

3. Design and implement functions to manipulate the rows and values in a sparse matrix.

4. Implement a method to solve a large scale linear system. The method solves the equation Ax = b for x, where A is a sparse matrix, b is the right-hand side vector, and x is the solution vector.
